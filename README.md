# 🍓 Fruit Slice - HTML5 Game

This is a fruit slicing game I built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. Inspired by Fruit Ninja, it includes cool features like:

- 🥭 Multiple fruit types
- 💣 Bombs that end the game
- 🧺 Legendary fruits that give bonus time and score
- ❄️ Freeze fruits that slow everything for 5 seconds
- 🎮 Swipe to slice (not just click!)
- 🔈 Background music toggle
- 🏆 High score saved in browser
- 📱 Mobile-friendly layout (Still Working On It)

## How to Play

- Click or swipe on fruits to slice them
- Avoid the bombs or the game ends
- Try to beat your high score before time runs out!

## Features I Implemented

- Custom fruit trail effects
- Blue trail glow during freeze time
- Animated glow for legendary fruits
- Smooth splash effects
- Responsive layout for all devices
